An infected person can spread measles to others even before he or she develops symptoms, and up to four days before developing a visible rash. You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. Almost everyone who has not had the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot will get measles if they are exposed to the measles virus. Almost everyone who gets both doses of the MMR shot will be protected. But some, including children with diseases such as leukemia whose immune systems have been compromised, can\u2019t be vaccinated. And doctors recommend that babies not receive the MMR vaccine until they are 12-14 months old. Until then, they are protected by the immunities they inherit from their mothers and by the likelihood that those around them have been vaccinated. Measles can cause serious health complications, such as pneumonia or even death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 1 out of every 1,000 people with measles will develop brain swelling (encephalitis). Even with the best care, 1 or 2 out of 1,000 people with measles will die.",
